☽ Re: Ideas and Concerns (Involving Response to Xenopter Population Policy)

☽ CC: MARKETING / PUBLIC AFFAIRS / ZOOLOGICAL DEPARTMENTS / LEGAL / NUCLEI DEATHSWORN

☽ Gentlemen,

☽ Recently we have been dealing with pressure to revise our 'bug tobacco' products in an effort to better protect the already dwindling native Xenopter population in this region of the Weave. Now, while this is certainly not all bad news, there are others who wish to move things in certain directions. Certainly our product has become ubiquitous in its market penetrance and *very* popular with various customer segments. This has not gone unnoticed among our competition, and we have recently noticed a rise in direct piracy, sub-category patent and trade name infringements and other press targeting. But worst of all, some political flunkies have received generous bribes to pursue an agenda corresponding to the hand of the NAVIGATORS. They would drive a wedge between the sustainable consumption of the XENOPTER and their virtual presence within the deep folds of OMNINET.

☽ Thanks to our allies in SYNTHCORP ALLIANCE, we are otherwise adroit in distracting such machinations and are prepared to 'shield' our product with a lovely assortment of networked branded propaganda and a number of targeted social subversion operations. The competing brands, however, are not so lucky...

☽ The PUBLIC AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT has, at their disposal, an issue report on the matter, with an accompanying presentation containing a veritable 'treasury' of NEW MARKETING INNOVATIONS, perfect for all over cybersplash and bluebrian hail on social networks.

☽ As you will know, the core markets remain under the suzerainty of DARK GLASS PRODUCTIONS and for those of us who know the codes, hold the trade routes and operate under the perpetual cover of their protection, we have near endless path opportunities in terms of this product range. The widescreen promovid "The Seven Suicide Cities of the Navigators" has proven an absolute hit within our most valued rock lifestyles, existential types, fashion and darknet subcult structure. The results of the implementation of this approach, through careful integration with XENOPTER POP SERVICES, have been of considerable success and help toward favorably sampling a wider demographic.

☽ Organizations supporting our research implementation recently have noted a positive shift in brand acknowledgment and attachment within selected segments. The same strategy could be used as part of a well-structured gameplan program as part of an extended integrated marketing campaign.

☽ Sincerely,

☽ L. Canbekit, Chairman & CEO of MARLBOUROBOROS INC.
