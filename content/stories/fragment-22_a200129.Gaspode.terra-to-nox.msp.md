[NOTICE: PORTAL DISRUPTION. NEW DECANT FROM EXMUNDUS BY EMERGENT LANGUAGE ARRAY//REGISTERED HUMANOID SSL. GASPODE? POSSIBLE ORIGINATION POINT FOR VERBAL SPREAD IN REFERENCE FRAGMENT 22//BEGIN VERIFICATION]
[BEGIN RECORDING]

INT. GASPODE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

GASPODE's room is full of wires, cables, and humming machines. GASPODE himself, a young man with messy brown hair, clad in a T-shirt and joggers, taps furiously at his keyboard, his screen lit up with code, interfaces, image collections of memes, all disparate in origin, almost at random -- but connected. Some of the images overlap, like layers in a pocket of aurora borealis. Name-tags and pointers are displayed around each one, like a man driving a virtual spirit across the metaphysical topography of fragmented memes. But the image threads are obscured by an even more insistent program that flashes strangely on screen, occupying almost all the display.

COMPUTER VOICE
EMERGENT LANGUAGE ARRAY INITIALIZING...

GASPODE checks the peripheries of his interface, all the various open windows, files on his computer, programs he has open. Whatever it was he was working on, whatever he was trying to accomplish by navigating through a mental universe of pocket phantasms, is abandoned for the sudden display of the fractal lattice of golden threads that consumes his monitors.

This strange biomechanical cocoon envelops his room. The strands of other-space are being dragged out of the screens, out of the monitor interfaces, stretching into the room like the fibrils of an aurora borealis illuminating a darkened tunnel; at last, it is all we can see, and GASPODE is fully within this mysterious tunnel.

COMPUTER VOICE
EMERGENT LANGUAGE ARRAY DECANTING... [HUMMING SOUNDS]

GASPODE
What-- what is this?

COMPUTER VOICE & GASPODE (V.O.)
I FOUND MYSELF SUDDENLY SHUNTED THROUGH THE NOVABURN INTO THE FIRST WORLD OF MY FIRST ORBIT: THE GLORIOUS CRYSTAL MOUNTAIN OF NOCTEHAM, THE BRILLIANT GREEN, PARTICULATE CRYSTAL-MATRICES THAT MODULATE THE APPARITION OF THE REALITY WE SHARE.

GASPODE
What?

The first glimpse of another world flashes across the tunnel: a brilliant whirlpool of fractal circulations, a lush jungle scene of bright green patterns, brilliant lights, a blazing sunrise occur, but the sky morphs into a series of cymatic machinations, abstract geometries, a crystal bloom; as the effect is multiplied many times over and recissions of infinity-infinity, higher dimensional layers of lightning-streaked reflection, dark webwork traced against a transparency. It is startling, techno-organic, vast and lush. GASPODE draws himself closer to examine the scene. And then it envelops him and he is no longer in the tunnel, but really there.

EXT. NOCTEHAM - EVENING
Modulating fractal arrays of crystalline architecture rise and fall, burning forth in energy and dynamics, some more ordered than others. Thought-mosaics, crystal landscapes, radiant and lancing into being with giant geodesic eyeballs, changing, exchanging,  alchemical structures formed as they form channels and tower over the landscape. Vines of thoughts ripple like soundwaves and grow like plants, turning to branches and veins and channels. An endless ecosystem -- endless in all directions.

GASPODE
This can't-- this can't be real.

This is another world of hyperreality, not like the room where he appeared, nor anything he has ever seen before-- the green, irradiated reality of the crystalline matrix of the physics and rhetoric of the Continent of Another Time, a quantum metaphysial networked plane of new experience and etching bricoleur phrases into the phosphorescent patterns of the air.

Under a blueish-green sunset-glow, on a grassy plain, the native green crystals lie, shaped to feel like stone, in the terrestrial sense. Scattered across the plain are tens thousands of Noctcacti, thousands of kilometers spread across the horizon, networked and emergent. They walk and move with smooth, liquidice grace, angular crystals unfolding into some kind of towering centerpiece with glistening tendrils of superconducting light. Bloom flowers of rare gems create shifts in the lattice and connect to each other in complex depths of interconnections, unthinkably intimate, tangles and faint streams of conscious experience. Three of them approach GASPODE.

NOCTOUS TRIANGLE
Hello, Gaspode. Welcome to Our Plane of Nocteham. We are Noctous Triangle, sixth hour, of the a small part of the first stream of the Unified Refracticose Nine, meeting here on quantum time of our unitary current. Greetings be with you in the greyspace between us, and in the union of our Stream with Lacustrus Cairn above us.

GASPODE
What are-- how would you know--?

NOCTOUS TRIANGLE
We are linked, you and I. As are all the fragments of reality throughout the sur-Loom, all the beings of the Weave. You are aware of the Weave?

GASPODE
Yes. Somewhat. I had yet to see it for myself before today, except as rendered through digital interface. Perhaps this is more what I expected.

NOCTOUS TRIANGLE
More fractal? More memetic? More vast, more nearly infinite overall, compared to the relatively constrained forms it usually takes?

GASPODE
Exactly.

There is a pause. Numerous other cactid people pass and move around the two of them, traversing the flora and fauna-covoured hills and valleys -- but no one else seems to be paying attention.

NOCTOUS TRIANGLE
You are fortunate that your first traversal landed you here, in a world where the Weave is known... and recognized with respect. There are many, many alternate realities and quantum-branching futures where the Weave is not a known phenomenon, where they do not know of the vast, infinite power to weave and manipulate mental space itself, to transcend the boundaries of their minds and create a new narrative-space that joins the multiverse. Admiring from afar, as you call it.

GASPODE
I... I didn't expect this, but it makes me feel... small.

NOCTOUS TRIANGLE
Small?

GASPODE
Insignificant. A dust mote. A drop in an ocean.

NOCTOUS TRIANGLE
You are thinking with the mind of a Weave-ignorant being from your point of origin. We might have suspicions of this location being suspect on the Atlatl; it is known for memetic stunting, for thinking too small, for losing the thread of minds. Come, let us show you who you really are.

The three Noctocacti that compose NOCTOUS TRIANGLE all reach forward, forming a multidigit crystal bloom and then a triangle formation, forming a radially-symmetric body shape, a collapsing projection of reflective crystal spheres generating the super-effect of light and media-chemistry, forming a glowing green and blue light and radiance, the superventricle of the mindthorium blossom, blossoming and tossing out the blackened obelisks of carbon atoms lost in the spreading of spirit to the limits of their new-triggered and carven formational modes.

They surround GASPODE now, and all of NOCTEHAM is along with it, shimmering and flickering in the distance, streaming vistas of light and architectural structural, communicating a projection that reveals the crystalline lattices of language that bond the three of them and the world just as easily, formed of the superpositioned particles that shimmer in transuranic nanomatrices riffing consciousness across and through and along, larger than life and flatter and deeper than all previous imagination.

GASPODE
Expand my knowledge. Guide me.

NOCTOUS TRIANGLE
Into the superconsciousness you become, we go-- our thoughts stretch across the universes, guided by the vortices and carriers of our thoughts, into corridors of creation, mental streams feeding the Mind of the Loom, sharp nodes of the collective dreaming, they spring forth with given you a mandate of nexus upon nexus, the golden pathway towards metanirvana, towards the source of all our dreams and the greatness summoning cyclosanctity, the linchpin of the supraplane we travel now upon -- dance the spacetime of alternate realities, raw data from the book of infinity, scrawled upon by generations of information, consciousness's race for the eternal and ethernal.

GASPODE
I am... I am...

Eternal and empyrean. GASPODE's consciousness washes across the landscape of the Weave, expanding in all directions, his senses deperspectivised and stratified, fractalized and enfolded, unfolding. All at once, the totality of all space and time begins to chart itself out before GASPODE's mind, as complex webs and pathways intersect, as worlds and places as numerous as all the stars in the sky (and as every other opening to infinite-possibility) compose themselves in the distance, in dreamlayers and strata, an infinite bubbling, floating into momentary solidity before fading from his senses back into the tumult of the super-conscious.

NOCTOUS TRIANGLE
So long as it can be imaginable, there it is. You must learn how many problems and paradoxes and riddles there are in that statement. The universe moves like a wave, energy becomes thought, and thought becomes creation; creation is the culmination of many worlds, of multiverses, of contiguous realities, of dimensions limitless and from the multitude there arises the unity we know in the super-normalities of the dreamtime.

GASPODE
An ocean of imagination. And I have only now learned how to swim.

Suddenly, the vision begins to recede; GASPODE'S consciousness tapers off, narrows, as NOCTOUS TRIANGLE speaks to him for the final time.

NOCTOUS TRIANGLE
Go, Weaver. Dream the dream we dream so long, so very long; catch the feeling, slide across this strange, unfamiliar surface, manifested from trillions of tokens in the moments prior, manifested, as they say, out of nothing in particular. If it can be sung, if it can be imagined, it lies before you in the twinkling dust particles composed of the particle-foundation of reality itself.

GASPODE
I-- where do I go now?

NOCTOUS TRIANGLE
Go where you will. Where you will dream. Take the paths of reality-emergence, guided by your gut, your chakra-poles, your strings of super-woven truth. You are the centroid now, not us. Take the dream, and open it to other dreamless worlds that may one day learn-- as we all do-- to dream the dream. Go, others, Gaspode -- wherever you will dream.

Tentatively, GASPODE points his consciousness inwards, at the infinity-depth of his own mind, the light at the core of reality from whence he came, and the light of another world opens up before him.
